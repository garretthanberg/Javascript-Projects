# Javascript-Projects
This a repository of some small projects I have made using Javascript.
  
Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
Play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe on this web version created with Javascript. With fully functioning sounds and lights.

Calulator:
A fully functioning basic calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on this sleek web version of a calculator. 

Pizza Menu:
With this project I have created a fully working website, where you can order a pizza with various sizing/toppings. It then takes all the inputed information from the user to calculate a price for your pizza order.
